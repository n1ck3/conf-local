2012-11-17 16:11:40	@root	For other things than bug reports, you can join #BitlBee on OFTC (irc.oftc.net) (OFTC, *not* FreeNode!) and flame us right in the face. :-)
2012-11-17 16:11:50	@nicke	quickstart
2012-11-17 16:11:50	@root	Unknown command: quickstart. Please use help commands to get a list of available commands.
2012-11-17 16:11:56	@nicke	help quickstart
2012-11-17 16:11:56	@root	Welcome to BitlBee, your IRC gateway to ICQ, MSN, AOL, Jabber, Yahoo! and Twitter.
2012-11-17 16:11:56	@root	The center of BitlBee is the control channel, &bitlbee. Two users will always be there, you (where "you" is the nickname you are using) and the system user, root.
2012-11-17 16:11:56	@root	You need register so that all your IM settings (passwords, contacts, etc) can be saved on the BitlBee server. It's important that you pick a good password so no one else can access your account. Register with this password using the register command: register <password> (without the brackets!).
2012-11-17 16:11:56	@root	Be sure to remember your password. The next time you connect to the BitlBee server you will need to identify <password> so that you will be recognised and logged in to all the IM services automatically.
2012-11-17 16:11:56	@root	When finished, type help quickstart2 to continue.
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@nicke	help quickstart2
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	Step Two: Add and Connect To your IM Account(s).
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	To add an account to the account list you will need to use the account add command: account add <protocol> <username> <password> [<server>].
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	For instance, suppose you have a Jabber account at jabber.org with handle bitlbee@jabber.org with password QuickStart, you would:
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	<you> account add jabber bitlbee@jabber.org QuickStart
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	<root> Account successfully added
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	Other available IM protocols are msn, oscar, yahoo and twitter. OSCAR is the protocol used by ICQ and AOL. For more information about the account add command, see help account add.
2012-11-17 16:12:09	@root	When you are finished adding your account(s) use the account on command to enable all your accounts, type help quickstart3 to continue.
2012-11-17 16:12:53	@nicke	acc add msn h3lbr0@gmail.com
2012-11-17 16:12:53	@root	Account successfully added with tag msn
2012-11-17 16:12:53	@root	You can now use the /OPER command to enter the password
2012-11-17 16:13:16	@nicke	acc msn on
2012-11-17 16:13:16	@root	Enter password for account msn first (use /OPER)
