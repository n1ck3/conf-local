Dependencies:
* zsh (as late as possible; >4.3.10 misses a lot of features)
* vim (latest and greatest with python support)
* tmux (latest and greatest for best results)

Good things happen:
* pyflakes (easy_install pyflakes)
* xorg
* herbstluftwm (aur: herbstluftwm-git)
* Storm

To install:
`cd && curl infect.ninjaloot.se | zsh - && echo n1ck3 > ~/.local/share/infect/.local && infect`

Then, to update at any time:
Just run `infect` at the command line.
